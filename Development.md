# Development

## Development plan/outline:

*Goal:* being able to `adb shell` / `telnet` / `SSH` into the `GNU/Linux` system where you can run tests related to `android` hardware enablement and they work out of the box.

*Reference device(s):* `Nexus 5`, `Oneplus one`, `Nexus 5X` (It will be interesting to see how easy it makes it for `Ubuntu Touch` once `Halium` works for this device).

*Reference rootfs:* `Ubuntu ARM` or `ArchLinux ARM` or `Debian ARM` or `Fedora ARM` (Requirement: `systemd` as main init system)

## Initial development (stage 0, libhybris):

- [ ] Fork the Android source tree with libhybris patches
- [ ] Bring continuous integration system up to build the android image
- [ ] Start with the basic rootfs (ubuntu 16.04)
- [ ] Build and integrate the libhybris (upstream) to the base rootfs
- [ ] Create publishing infrastructure for the distribution of the android image and rootfs
- [ ] At this point it's fine if not all tests "pass" but they should at least run.

## Hardware enablement (stage 1):

- [ ] After stage 0 we will have a system to work on where we are able to run the `libhybris` tests and get the logs required, in this stage we can pick random hardware component and get it working
- [ ] At end of this stage, Halium is "ready" for distributions

## Device enablement (stage 2):

- [ ] During this stage we will have most of the infrastructure ready for including new devices, so this is the time to go wild ;-)

*Tests:* We need to write tests that can run in our reference rootfs to make it easier to spot problems, we need both direct tests that live in `android` and tests that use `libhybris`.

*Automated tests:* These tests will run run after each `CI` build to ensure the builds that comes out of our build servers are working. (@UBports has some tests we can use for this)

## Future ideas

- [ ] Common upstream msm kernel for all devices
- [ ] Common sets of qcom drivers
- [ ] All qcom devices to caf
- [ ] Freedreno for mainlined devices
- [ ] Backport 5.1 and 6.0 kernel driver required by 5.1 and 6.0 blobs
- [ ] Upstream the Android N port of libhybris from UBports fork
- [ ] Common place to put device configs for userspace (not talking about android device configs here, but the config each OS uses to configure different parts)
- [ ] Create a _translator_ that converts common configs to OS specific configs
- [ ] Possibly something to "update" kernel from distribution packaging. I remember @mickybart/gnulinux_support has something around that.
- [ ] Create a sandbox env to test _only_ the hal and libhybris
