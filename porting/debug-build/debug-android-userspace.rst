Debugging the Android userspace
===============================

Debugging the Android userspace

lxc-android
-----------
lxc-android is the container in which the Android userspace is running. You can check that it is started with the following command::

    systemctl status lxc@android

LXC needs some kernel config to make sure it runs correctly. Check that you have all the needed options by running the following command on the device::

    lxc-checkconfig

All option except `User namespace` need to be the green word `enabled`. If one of the options is a yellow `missing` or a red `required`, then you need to change the kernel config, rebuild hybrid-boot and check the status again.

.. note::

    I was getting the following error, which I didn't understand:
    ``lxc-start: utils.c: mkdir_p: 254 Invalid argument - failed to create directory '/sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls//lxc/android'``
    It appears like LXC is expecting some functionality that doesn't work yet in Linux 3.4. Counter-intuitively I had to disable the following functionalities in the defconfig to make it work::

        CONFIG_NET_CLS_CGROUP=n
        CONFIG_NETPRIO_CGROUP=n

Logcat
------

Logcat is a tool that reads the Android userspace logs. This includes all services that should be running in Halium. You can run it at any time with the following command::

   /system/bin/logcat

For radio (Wi-Fi, GSM, LTE) logs, you can add a flag::

   /system/bin/logcat -b radio

dmesg
-----

Even though Android logs does not normally end up in dmesg, early initialization of Android and kernel output ends up here::

   dmesg

Debug Libhybris crash
---------------------

One of the main problems with the current Hybris based architecture, is the lack of symbols resolution and mapping once a crash happens at the Android layer. To workaround this we need to manuly import non stripped libaries

.. todo::

    Add information for importing debug libhybris libraries.
