Logging in
==========

Once booted, the reference rootfs will offer an SSH connection that you can use to run tests or otherwise debug the system. Before you're able to sign in, though, you will need to change the root user's password.

To change the root user's password, reboot into TWRP and get access via ``adb shell``. Then, perform the following commands::

    mkdir /a
    mount /data/system.img /a
    chroot /a /bin/bash
    . /etc/environment
    passwd

You will be prompted to change the password. Once finished, clean up::

    exit
    umount /a
    rmdir /a
    sync

You may now reboot your device into Halium.

Once your device is booted, you should see that you have a new network interface again. Assign it an IP of 10.15.19.100. Once finished, you should be able to do the following to log in::

    ssh root@10.15.19.82
