# Hardware and Kernel Enablement

This page is meant as an overview of
  * **What Hardware may be inside a smart phone** 
  * **Which of those parts need a kernel driver** = probably all
  * **What is eachs components current status?** = mainline(since)/wip/blob

**Please be aware that mainlining is A PROCESS** so sometimes "mainline" doesn't mean the same for two chips. However we will use the term in this overview as in "the chip is being mainlined beginning with kernel v.xx) and a detailed overview shall be given on a sub page or an external reference.

## How to use this Overview

If you are trying to document the parts of a new or incomplete documented device the chips should all be listed in the [Devices Overview Page]() and on each devices sub page.

Every hardware part should be listed on this page in it's category (connectivity, sensors, ...) and link to a **detailed sub page** with further info if possible **while only open source status should be presented here**.

Also in the tables below, it would be very useful to know with which kernel version certain drivers were mainline so please try to take the time to **document the kernel version of each's components mainlining success**

### Where to find software status

How to find all hardware related data is documented on the Devices Overview. However, it's not that trivial to find out if there is an open source (or even mainlined) driver of the specific component. Essentially, you need to search [the linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) and drivers should be inside the folder _drivers/_. **Always keep in mind that abbreviations are used** e.g. qcom instead of Qualcomm.

  

There are many ways to search for specific drivers. I'll need to tinker a little bit or ask around to find out which way works best. All ways shall be listed below

1. You can for example manually browse the mainline kernel by clicking on 'browse' there, then navigate to the 'tree' section and then click yourself through the drivers folder
2. You can search linux kernel mailing lists like [the linux-arm-kernel archives](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/) for specific hardware
3. For **Qualcomm SoCs** there is a community driven [qualcomm mainlining wiki](http://elinux.org/Qualcomm_SOC_Mainlining_Project) as is for **Allwinner** @ [sunxi mainlining](http://linux-sunxi.org/Linux_mainlining_effort)
4. You can also look into [kernel changes on kernelnewbies.org](https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges)
5. Wicket from the Maemo community also has a short [list of devices](https://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=99357) and their status pages.

#### SoC support @ Device Tree Source (dts) folder

Modern ARM devices should have their own **device tree** inside the mainline kernel. For a really good reference check out ['Device Tree for Dummies'](http://free-electrons.com/pub/conferences/2014/elc/petazzoni-device-tree-dummies/petazzoni-device-tree-dummies.pdf) by Thomas Petazzoni from [Free Electrons](http://free-electrons.com/). Also from Thomas Petazzoni is the great [ARM-soc-checklist](http://elinux.org/images/a/ad/Arm-soc-checklist.pdf) (they really produce stunning docs there)

For all ARM based smart phones and tablets this should be inside 
```
root/arch/arm/boot/dts/
```
or if your using 64-bit arm64 (e.g. BQ Aquaris M10) all files are sorted by manufacturer inside
```
root/arch/arm64/boot/dts/
```


## System Components

### System-on-Chips (SoC)

#### Device specific dts
**Please only include SoCs that are used inside any smart phone/tablet** and have a smart phone/tablet *.dts file.

| Manufacturer |   SoC   |       Board        |   Mainline(since)    |                  file                  | armhf/arm64 |
| :----------- | :-----: | :----------------: | :------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :---------: |
| Qualcomm     | APQ8064 |    Asus Nexus 7    |      since 4.6       |    qcom-apq8064-asus-nexus7-flo.dts    |    armhf    |
| Qualcomm     | APQ8064 |  Sony Xperia yuga  | ? is inside 4.12-rc2 |   qcom-apq8064-sony-xperia-yuga.dts    |    armhf    |
| Qualcomm     | MSM8974 |     LG Nexus 5     |  ? inside 4.12-rc2   | qcom-msm8974-lge-nexus5-hammerhead.dts |    armhf    |
| Qualcomm     | MSM8974 | Sony Xperia Honami |  ? inside 4.12-rc2   |  qcom-msm8974-sony-xperia-honami.dts   |    armhf    |

Here, we directly see what is the benefit of these tables -> The Qualcomm MSM8974 SoC is already mainlined and there are several boards one can use as a reference to e.g. **write a fairphone2.dts** with the purpose to one day mainline it! Also, the APQ8064 SoC is used inside Nexus 4 as well...

#### General dts
Below are gathered mainlined SoCs and Smart phones/Tablets that use it but do not have a device-specific *.dts yet.

### GPU
There is sadly only a very short list of open source driver projects, mainly [Etnaviv](https://github.com/etnaviv/etna_viv) which is for VIvante GCxxx embedded GPUs and [Freedreno](https://github.com/freedreno/freedreno) for Ardreno GPUs (there was also once lima for mali GPUs, however it seems more or less abandoned, although just recently there was news that someone from AMD is trying to rewrite it as [mesa-lima](https://github.com/yuq/mesa-lima)).

## How to test a new kernel 

There is some [nice documentation](http://www.lieberbiber.de/2015/07/02/hacking-the-bq-part-4-building-and-booting-a-kernel/) by Simon Raffeiner at his blog how to boot a new kernel in Ubuntu Touch (MediaTek devices only!) once for testing. 

**TODO: Add info about this on Android/Others**
