rolex - Xiaomi Redmi 4a
===========================

A Snapdragon 425 (MSM8917) budget phone from Xiaomi released in 2016 that is great on its own. Comes with MIUI 8 (Marshmallow), upgradeable to MIUI 9 (Nougat).

It has 2GB LPDDR3 RAM, 16GB/32GB eMMC storage.

An updated version of this device Redmi 5a (riva) was released in 2017. Both are basically the same, and share device trees and kernels. So anything that applies to 4a should as well apply to 5a
