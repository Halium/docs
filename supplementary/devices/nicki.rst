Nicki - Sony Xperia M
===========================

Xperia M is very weak, especially by today's standards. But it runs Halium. Somehow.

Status

Halium
^^^^^^

There is an ongoing port of Halium for Nicki that `Konrad Dybcio <https://github.com/ewentual>`_ is working on. Halium-7.1 branch builds with LOS 14.1 sources. Halium rootfs can be flashed using `halium-install by JBB <https://github.com/JBBgameich/halium-install>`_, yet /data partition is too small (2 gigs) to fit a plasma mobile rootfs. This can be worked around by changing IMAGE_SIZE=2G to for example IMAGE_SIZE=1.7G for pm in halium-install/functions/distributions.sh.

Device Specifics

Guides
^^^^^^

Special boot modes

Fastboot: With the device powered off, while holding Volume Up, connect the USB cable to the computer. The LED should turn blue.

Flashmode: With the device powered off, while holding Volume Down, connect the USB cable to the computer. The LED should turn green. Then you can go back to the stock rom using `Androxyde's Flashtool <http://www.flashtool.net/downloads.php>`_. Last sure to be working with nicki version of Flashtool was 0.9.18.6, newer versions could fail.

Recovery (ONLY on android custom kernels): On boot, press Volume Down when the LEDs start lighting up. This only works with a working boot image. If there is none, you can flash twrp to boot partition first and use it to reboot into recovery.

Second Recovery: To boot to the FOTA Recovery follow recovery instruction, but press Volume Up instead.

Developer Info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With hybris-boot only way to access TWRP is to flash it as boot.
