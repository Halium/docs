Nicki - Sony Xperia M
===========================

Xperia M is very weak, especially by today's standards. But it runs Halium. Somehow.

Status
------

Halium
^^^^^^

There is an ongoing port of Halium for Nicki that `Konrad Dybcio <https://github.com/ewentual>`_ is working on. Halium-7.1 branch builds with slightly tweaked LOS 14 sources (manifest will be published soon). Halium rootfs can be flashed using `halium-install by JBB <https://github.com/JBBgameich/halium-install>`_, yet /data partition is too small (2 gigs) to fit a plasma mobile rootfs.

Device Specifics

Guides
^^^^^^

Special boot modes

Fastboot: With the device powered off, while holding Volume Up, connect the USB cable to the computer. The LED should turn blue.

Recovery: On boot, press Volume Down when the LEDs start lighting up. This only works with a working boot image. If there is none, you can flash twrp to boot partition first and use it to reboot into recovery.

Second Recovery: To boot the FOTA Recovery, press Volume Up instead. This seems to be equal to Recovery.

Developer Info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With hybris-boot only way to access TWRP is to flash it as boot.
