Kernel & Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mainline (vX.Y.Z as of writing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write whether something that is needed for the device is mainline already (switch the version in the heading for what's recent when you write this). This means **device tree source files (.dts) as well as single drivers** (for example only the wifi driver).

Cyanogemod based kernels (LOS & UBP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If other kernels exist, just make up headlines with a name that describe the origin (Cyanogemod, LineageOS, UBports, Canonical, ...) and which is the underlying mainline version. Afterwards describe what's been improved or altered and if possible why or what is still missing.

Guides
^^^^^^

This should be populated with guides how to get into different boot modes and similar. Maybe this can be pulled from the `LOS device database <https://github.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki/tree/master/_data/devices>`_.

Developer Info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some devices show strange behaviour of some kind, try to find this (for example in the xda-developers forum) and document it
