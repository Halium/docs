Yuga - Sony Xperia Z
=====================

Here only one or two sentences. What makes the device special? Is it a reference device? 

Status
------

Halium
^^^^^^

There is a **working Halium 7.1** made by `LNJ2 <https://github.com/LNJ2>`_ and the according Halium/Projectmanagement issue is `here <https://github.com/Halium/projectmanagement/issues/19>`_.

Distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following entries are just a placeholder, exactly as this sentence.

Kernel & Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mainline (vX.Y.Z as of writing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write whether something that is needed for the device is mainline already (switch the version in the heading for what's recent when you write this). This means **device tree source files (.dts) as well as single drivers** (for example only the wifi driver).

Cyanogemod based kernels (LOS & UBP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If other kernels exist, just make up headlines with a name that describe the origin (Cyanogemod, LineageOS, UBports, Canonical, ...) and which is the underlying mainline version. Afterwards describe what's been improved or altered and if possible why or what is still missing.

Device Specifics
----------------

Guides
^^^^^^

This should be populated with guides how to get into different boot modes and similar. Maybe this can be pulled from the `LOS device database <https://github.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki/tree/master/_data/devices>`_.

Developer Info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some devices show strange behaviour of some kind, try to find this (for example in the xda-developers forum) and document it

Usefull Ressources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If anything might be usefull but didn't fit above you can just throw in some links here.
