Kernel & Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mainline (v3.10.108 as of writing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything required is already patched in kernel source and is fully upstreamed. Patches from CAF and Linux are also merged already.

Cyanogemod based kernels (LOS & UBP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both **Halium and LOS share a common base** which is Cyanogenmod. However, the Halium kernel was pacthed with Halium-specific edits. Currently some kernel flags and additional patches were used.
