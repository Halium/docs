# BQ Aquaris E4.5 aka krillin

### Kernel & Hardware
#### Mainline (4.13rc4 as of writing)
There is no Mediatek MT-6582 device source tree present inside the mainline kernel yet.

#### Canonical's kernel (3.4.67 based)
The [kernel from canonical](https://github.com/bq/aquaris-E4.5/tree/aquaris-E4.5-ubuntu-master) especially saw some backporting. AFAIK with this kernel every feature except radio worked.

#### Pablito2020 inofficial LOS kernel (3.10.49 based?)

This kernel (linked in table) seems to be more recent and is said to work completely with a CM13 base.
