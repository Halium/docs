griffin - Motorola Moto Z
===========================

**//Disclaimer:** Please remove everything that is just part of this template and not actually about the device before submitting this into the official wiki, thank you! **//**

The Moto Z is cheap, has a decent, mid-range hardware and LineageOS sources available (14.1 - 17.1), which makes it solid choice for porting.

Status
------

Halium
^^^^^^

**Status**: Sources compile, but install fails.

A Halium 7.1. port for the Moto Z is worked on by `Stefan Thaler <https://github.com/stefanthaler>`.  The project management issue can be found `here <https://github.com/Halium/projectmanagement/issues/193>`
