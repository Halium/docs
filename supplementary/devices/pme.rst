HTC 10 aka PME (Perfume)
========================

In 2015, HTC released the HTC One M9 smartphone, which was praised for its design, but criticized for being too similar to its predecessor, the HTC One (M8). To address the shortcomings of the M9, HTC released another new phone that year with a new design and hardware: the HTC One A9. The design of the HTC 10 is somewhat of a mix of the M9 and the A9

Kernel & Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mainline (vX.Y.Z as of writing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write whether something that is needed for the device is mainline already (switch the version in the heading for what's recent when you write this). This means **device tree source files (.dts) as well as single drivers** (for example only the wifi driver).

Cyanogemod based kernels (LOS & UBP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both **Halium and LOS share a common base** which is Cyanogenmod. However the Halium kernel was pacthed with Halium-specific edits. Currently only kernel flags in ``pme_defconfig`` were altered

Device Specifics
----------------

Guides
^^^^^^

HTC allowed users to officially unlock phones without S-Off. Links provided below

This device has 2 modes for fastboot: ``bootloader`` (white backgrond) and ``download`` (dark background). You have to use ``download`` mode in order to flash/wipe anything. AFAIK bootloader mode is only used to check it's status and for emergency purposes

In order to launch recovery, you have to boot into ``download`` mode first (Power + Volume Down), then select ``reboot to bootloader``\ , and only then ``boot to recovery mode``

Also, be sure to check `LOS device info <https://github.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki/blob/master/_data/devices/pme.yml>`_

Developer Info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This device is mostly open and has no weird behaviour
